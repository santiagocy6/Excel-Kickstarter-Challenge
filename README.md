## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project is make some formulas, changes, pivot tables and charts filtering a dataset with too many information, to get a specific analysis and results 

## Analysis and Challenges 
This project made me feel very comfortable, It had some parts like the pivot tables that were little confusing but, I used all the tools that I had on Canvas and also Internet to do everything, It is very important and useful read and understand step by step of the Challenge then you can do things easier.
These were the sites used by me [Canvas Bootcamp](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1378/modules)

**Conclusions about Theater Outcomes by Launch Date**
1. Number of cancelations was always under 10, and the successful percentage was up of 40%     
2. December was the month with less Grand Total with a total of 75, but the rest of the months were up of 88 and maximum 166. 

**Conclusion about Outcomes based on Goals**
First at all it was good that the percentage of cancelations was 0,00%, I also can visualize that after 14999 the total projects was going down. Between 1000 and 14999 the Percentage successful was up of 53%, but between 15000 and 34999 was less or equal at 50%.
